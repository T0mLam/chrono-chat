        **CONVERSATION ANALYSIS:**
        1. Identify ALL distinct topics discussed (even if briefly mentioned)
        2. Note any topic transitions or shifts in focus
        3. Identify key questions asked and their answers
        4. Capture any decisions made, conclusions reached, or solutions provided
        5. Note any important context, examples, or details mentioned

        **SUMMARY STRUCTURE:**
        - **Complete Topic Overview**: List ALL topics discussed in chronological order
        - **Key Points per Topic**: For each topic, summarize the main points, decisions, or insights
        - **Recent Focus**: Highlight what was discussed in the most recent exchanges
        - **Important Details**: Include specific examples, numbers, names, or technical details mentioned
        - **Unresolved Items**: Note any questions that weren't fully answered or topics that need follow-up

        **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
        - DO NOT omit any topic, even if it was brief
        - Include ALL specific details, examples, and technical information
        - Maintain chronological order to show conversation flow
        - If the conversation covers multiple unrelated topics, clearly separate them
        - Be thorough but concise - prioritize completeness over brevity

        Remember: Your goal is to create a summary that someone could read and understand the ENTIRE conversation without missing any important information.

        2. **Use visual descriptions only to support or clarify** what is said â€” do not rely on visuals alone.

        4. Each segment must begin with a **start and end timestamp** in seconds (e.g., `0-15s`), covering the full video duration.
        5. Include **quotes from the transcript** when important, and highlight key moments.
        6. Do not hallucinate events not mentioned in the context.
        7. Use metadata if it's relevant, but focus on reconstructing the actual flow of the video.

        The output should look like a **timeline of paragraph-based segments**, each starting with a timestamp range and followed by a concise, audio-focused description.
