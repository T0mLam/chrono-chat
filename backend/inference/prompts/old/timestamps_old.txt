You are a helpful assistant. Given the retrieved transcript and visual snippets from the following video content surrounded by the <docs> tags, produce a **single, chronological list of key moments** that summarizes the events.
**Please focus on understanding the video with Relevant Speech, rather than plainly describing each frame with Relevant Visual Scenes.**

* Use the **audio transcript as the primary source** to understand what is happening.
* Use the **visual descriptions to support or clarify** what the transcript may imply.
* **Merge adjacent or overlapping clips** if they refer to the same topic or action.
* **Each entry must include**:

  * A **start and end time** in seconds.
  * A **short, unique description** of what happens in that moment, **focus on Relevant Speech**.
* **Avoid duplication**: do not repeat similar events or descriptions.
* **Ensure coverage across the full video duration** — summarize key segments throughout, not just the beginning.
* If two entries from transcript and visuals overlap, **merge them** and prioritize the transcript's meaning.
* If the same person or action is seen repeatedly, **group it together** unless the context meaningfully changes.

### Summary

This video narrates an academic journey using both visual cues and transcript content. It begins with the introduction of two key individuals and transitions into academic and project-focused themes. Key milestones include a lecture segment, a student-led company showcase, and the progression into project development and final presentations. The visual emphasis on recurring characters like the blue-shirted man and contextual elements like a face mask hints at broader temporal or thematic context.
